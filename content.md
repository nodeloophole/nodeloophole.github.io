### Today I want to talk about how to make your Drupal practice more efficient.

note:
I don't know that anything I'll cover today will be revolutionary or groundbreaking. But I hope I can provide you with 
information in such a way that it gives you ideas and actions that you can take with you so that your Drupal practice
becomes more efficient.

# Four Questions

- What types of skills make up an efficient Drupal team?
- What are some practical ways that a Drupal team can increase efficiency?
- How can a Drupal team stay motivated and engaged without experiencing burnout?
- How can project managers help with efficiency?

note:
A lot of the concepts described in this presentation address more than one question.

# Skills of a Drupal Team

---

## The basics

---
##### The Basics
## Direct Skills
Drupal, PHP, CSS, JS, Symfony, Git

## Related Skills
Frameworks, DevOps/server management, Search, etc.

note:
These are pretty straight-forward. These are any key skills that are required for the job. 
Related skills are anything not directly required, but helpful or nice-to-have skills.

---
## Soft Skills

note: 
Soft skills are those which aren't objectively measured. These skills are sometimes overlooked or seen as not required.  
I say that these are sometimes just as important as the basic skills. These skills help make sure
your team is working at peak efficiency.

---
##### Soft Skills

## Communication
* Can articulate ideas, thoughts, problems, etc.
* Not afraid to speak up
* Listening and understanding
* Uses the correct 'voice' for the audience

note:
Voice/tone/word choice varies based on the audience. For example, someone should speak at a technical
level when dealing with other developers. Potentially less technical when dealing with clients.

---
##### Soft Skills

## Bias toward action
* Eager to solve problems
* Discussion/research versus action

note:
Does someone want to get their hands dirty and solve problems? 

---
##### Soft Skills

## Constant Learning and Sharing
* Growing knowledge and experience to learn at a higher level
* Proactive vs reactionary
* Recognizing "I could have done better" and learning how for next time
* Openly shares knowledge with others
* Offers help when others are in need

note:
Someone who is constantly striving to learn more about their craft is better prepared to identify potential problems
before they become real problems. This proactive response to situations helps minimize re-work down the road when
reacting to problems.  
Someone that recognizes the value of sharing information with others is an asset to your team. They know that doing so
elevates all team members which makes your team more knowledgeable and more efficient.

---
##### Soft Skills

## Taking Ownership

* Taking ownership of a task or challenge
* Finding resources to solve problems
  - People
  - Information
  - Technologies
  
note:
Someone that takes ownership knows their responsibility to see a task through to completion. If they don't have the 
necessary resources, they find them. As a project manager or another team member, you should have confidence that a
developer will take the task and see it through. Of course if there are blockers, they note those and solve the ones
that can be easily unblocked.

---
##### Soft Skills

## Ability to Focus
* Spend effort on right priority at the right time
* Saying 'No' or 'Not now' to requests
* Push away distractions

note:
A developer should be able to know where their focus should be at any given time. This is particularly useful when a 
developer is on multiple projects...Knowing the most important thing to work on is critical. Part of focus is the ability
to say "no" or "not right now" to incoming requests that get in the way. Also, pushing away distractions like social
media,  or other things that take away from time-on-task is a component of keeping focused. 

---
##### Soft Skills

## Take-aways 

* Look for examples of these when interviewing candidates
* Look for opportunities to encourage and strengthen these in current team members

note:
When interviewing applicants for a job opening, ask questions that will help uncover some of these skills. For example:
"Assume that I'm not a technical person for a moment. Give me a quick overview of how Views work." Also, when you find 
examples of current team members who are demonstrating these qualities and highlight them for your team to see.

## Assess your Drupal team

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Skills Assessment
* Be honest - internal use only
* Identify your team's strengths and weaknesses

note:
This is an opportunity for you have a good baseline measure of where your team stands. It's important to be honest about 
this. It should be for internal use only.  It will let you know where your team's strengths and weaknesses are.
---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Technical knowledge

* Drupal - get specific
* Languages, frameworks, other technologies
* Courses, certifications, awards, etc.

note:
The first part is a good assessment of everyone's technical capabilities. 

When assessing Drupal skills, get specific -- More than just backend / frontend for D7 or D8. Ask questions like:
Do they have knowledge with field formatters, with creating twig templates, with configuration management, with writing 
event subscribers, with the render array, etc.

For courses and certifications, get a list of these. it can be helpful to highlight these when going after new work. And
when someone gets a new certification or award, that's something for your whole team to celebrate.

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Domain knowledge

* Industry experience
* Types of clients

note:
This can include work that people have done in other industries before they worked as a developer. It can also include
the types of websites/clients that someone has experience building.  These can provide a lot of strategic information
for your organization when going after new deals or trying to find the right people to staff a new project.

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Take-aways

* Know what type of work to go for
* Find ways to improve
* Identify next steps
* Create a roadmap and work it

note:
It's important to take action based on the findings of your skills assessment. After you find ways to improve, know what 
type of work to go for, and create your roadmap for leveling-up, work the plan.

# Increasing efficiency in your Drupal process

---
# Efficiency != Productivity

* Productivity = measure of units produced
* Efficiency = amount of resources used and waste created

When there is less waste, there is more capacity to produce.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Before starting to build

* Agree on the work to be done
    - What is in scope?
    - What does done look like?
    - Have a common nomenclature for items
    
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Before starting to build

* Plan
    - Resolve as many unanswered questions as possible
    - Content model, roles and permissions (palantir.net template: https://goo.gl/1sSs8h)
    - Know what Drupal modules to use
    - Use the right technologies for the work to be done

note: 
Plan the route before starting your journey. For the build out of a Drupal site, this can include
planning out content types, taxonomy vocabularies, modules to use, modules to build, roles and 
permissions, etc. 
Palantir.net has template for a build specification that can be used or customized for your organization. This is Drupal 7,
but can be adapted for D8 (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15htLLWLguhwiuTLg_nndQNpgWVdUMy6UaR_d1q-v6iw/edit#gid=0) from
 blog post: https://www.palantir.net/blog/developing-drupal-sites-plan-or-perish.
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Standard tools and processes
 
 * Standardize the toolkit 
  - Computers, IDE, other software, etc.
  - Development environment
  - Project/Task management process
  
note: 
Greater efficiency can be achieved if everyone is using the same tools. 

This goes back to being on the same page. 

And this not on a per-project basis, but across projects. If you can lower the amount of ramp-up time spent on a project, 
or on task switching time, you can be more efficient.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Have a common starting point

* Base Drupal installation profile
* Custom code snippets/scaffolding
* This is your secret recipe

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Don't re-invent the wheel

* Avoid doing things totally different each time
* Leverage the knowledge you have

note:
If you do a lot of work for law firms, and you see that they almost always have a attorney directory... why not have your
"go to" approach and use it every time?

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Let developers develop

* Tech support
* Unneeded meetings 
* Bureaucracy

note:
This one sounds obvious, but there are a lot of little things that add up quickly.
Things like doing internal tech support, attending meetings where the developer has no clear role or
objective for attending, 

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## It's OK to have specialists

* Not the same as putting work into a silo
* Specialists allow for deeper knowledge for the whole team

note:
Example:  configuration management or event subscribers, others can benefit from this knowledge.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Follow good development practices

* Do the basics well
  - Coding standards
  - Code reviews
  - Documenting
  - The Drupal way
  
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Build with the future in mind

* Where possible:
 - Know the goals of future versions
 - Lay the foundation for future work

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Invest in continued growth

* Training and education
* Local events - meetups, camps, etc.
* Internal training / info share

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Avoid multi-tasking when possible

* Time costs related to task switching
* Better to time box effort 
* Group meetings together

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Fix bugs immediately

* Building on top of bugs, causes more bugs
* "We'll fix it in QA/UAT" is a dangerous phrase

note:
I recommend fixing bugs immediately. Other work currently being built may incorporate the bug and 
 break when the bug is fixed.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Take-aways

* Look for places in your Drupal process that are inefficient
* Eliminate duplicate or repetitive effort when possible
* Invest in people, letting them work the work

# Keep the team motivated

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Strive for daily production

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Work/life balance

* While initially productive, working too much can be inefficient
 - Increased stress
 - More mistakes/bugs
 - Not sustainable
 
---
##### Keep the team motivated

Explain the "Why"

* "Why am I doing this?" can be de-motivating
* Helps put this piece into the bigger picture
* Perhaps better options are available

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Developers aren't simply resources

* Check in to see if developers are happy on the project
* Talk about other stuff with the team--develop rapport

---
##### Keep the team motivated

## Take-aways

* Help developers be productive while maintaining balance
* Make sure that developers know how their work fits into the big picture

# Project management helps efficiency

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Don't allow the build to start too soon

* Push back against the pressure
* Helps lower re-work
* Can be used as leverage to get what you need

note:
There is sometimes pressure to start building, before scope/requirements are locked down.
Push back against this when possible. It helps avoid re-work / unscoped work.
If you need leverage to get sign-off...use this if possible

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Reign in ambitious developers

* Developers sometimes advocate for experimental approaches that can take away from efficiency
   - "We could do it this other way"
   - Want to try something new
  
note: 
Developers can get excited in wanting to try new things or approaching things in 
different ways. At times that's good. At other times, staying the course is the 
most beneficial to the project. 

---
##### Project management helps efficiency
 
Tease out when a developer is having problems

* Have an understanding of how long a task should take
* Use stand-ups / status meeting to uncover delays
 - Need help?
 - Spinning wheels
 - Other interference / distractions

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Transparency with the whole team

* Don't shield the team from the numbers 
* Keep everyone abreast of the latest information

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Let developers show off their work

* Let developers do demos of their work to the clients/stakeholders
 - Builds ownership within the team
 - Builds stronger rapport with the client
 - Direct feedback/conversation can spur discussion and new ideas

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

## Take-aways

* Look at project management process for ways to increase efficiency
* Work with developers to help them become for efficient in their work

---
