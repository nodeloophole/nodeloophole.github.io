# Skills of a Drupal Team

---

## The basics

note: this is obvious, so i'm not going to dwell on the basics. 
These are the must-have skills for a someone to contribute to your team 

---
##### The Basics
## Direct Skills
Drupal, PHP, CSS, JS, Symfony

---
##### The Basics

## Related Skills
Frameworks, DevOps, Git, etc.

---
## Soft Skills

note: These skills are sometimes overlooked or seen as not required.  I say that these are
sometimes just as important as the basic skills. These skills help make sure
your team is working at peak efficiency.

---
##### Soft Skills

## Communication
* Can articulate ideas, thoughts, problems, etc.
* Not afraid to speak up.
* Listening and understanding
* Uses the correct 'voice' for the audience.

note:
Voice/tone/word choice varies based on the audience. For example, someone should speak at a technical
level when dealing with other developers. Potentially less technical when dealing with clients.

## Assess your Drupal team

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

# Increasing efficiency in your Drupal team

---

# Efficiency != Productivity

Productivity = measure of units produced.
Efficiency = amount of resources used and waste created.

When there is less waste, capacity to produce more increases.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Before starting to build

* Agree on the work to be done
    - All on the same page
    - What is in scope?
    - What does done look like?
    - Have a common nomenclature for items
    
    
note:
Speaking the same language is critical for efficiency in your team. 
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Before starting to build

* Plan
    - Resolve as many unanswered questions as possible.
    - Content model, roles and permissions.
    - Know what Drupal modules to use.
    - Use the right frameworks for the work to be done.

note: 
Plan the route before starting your journey. For the build out of a Drupal site, this
 
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Standard tools for all
 
 * Standardize the toolkit 
  - IDE
  - Development
  - Project/Task management process
  
  
note: 
Greater efficiency can be achieved if everyone is using the same tools. 

This goes back to being on the same page. 

And this not on a per-project basis, but across projects. If you can lower the amount of ramp-up time spent on a project, or on task swithcing time, you can be more efficient.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Let developers develop

* Tech support
* Unneeded meetings 
* Bureaucracy

note:
This one sounds obvious, but there are a lot of little things that add up quickly.
Things like doing internal tech support, attending meetings where the develop has no clear role or
objective for attending, 

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## It's OK to have specialists

* Not the same as putting work into a silo
* Specialists allow for deeper knowledge for the whole team

note:
Example:  configuration management or event subscribers, others can benefit from this knowledge.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Follow good development practices

* Do the basics well
  - Coding standards
  - Code reviews
  - Documenting
  
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Minimize Rework

* Fully understand requirements
* Prototype for customer review
* Focus on quality
* Manage expectations

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Build with the future in mind

* Where possible:
 - Know the goals of future versions
 - Lay the foundation for future work

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Invest in continued growth

* Training and education
* Local events - meetups, camps, etc.
* Internal training / info share

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Simplify the work

* Keep code simple
* Break down complex tasks into manageable chunks
* Don't over-engineer solutions

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Have a common starting point

* Base Drupal installation profile
* Features for everyone
* Custom code snippets/scaffolding
* This is your secret recipe

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Don't re-invent the wheel

* Avoid doing things totally different each time
* Leverage the knowledge you have
* Custom code snippets/scaffolding

note: How different are hero carousels , really? 

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Productize your solutions

* Where possible, have pre-build solutions for a fixed price
* Use that as a base and enhance per customer requirements
* Caveat: Be aware of contractual issues

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Avoid multi-tasking when possible

* Time costs related to task switching
* Better to time box effort 
* Prioritize most important work first

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Fix bugs immediately

note:
I recommend fixing bugs immediately. Other work currently being built may incorporate the bug and 
 break when the bug is fixed.
 
"We'll fix it in QA/UAT" is a dangerous phrase.

# Keep the team motivated

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Strive for daily production


---
##### Keep the team motivated

Don't allow all-nighters

* While initially productive, can be inefficient.
 - Increased stress
 - More mistakes/bugs
 - Not sustainable
 
* Work/life balance

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Transparency

* Keep everyone abreast of the latest information
* No hidden agendas, side-conversations, or masked motives

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Explain the "Why"

* "Why am I doing this?" can be de-motivating
* Perhaps better options are available
* Helps put this piece into the bigger picture

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Don't micro-manage

note:
Even if a PM has technical abilities, its really important to let the team architect things 
and make collective decisions.  Often times a PM that is somewhat technical will try to tell 
developers how to do something, which shoots themselves in the foot in 2 ways:  
1) It might not be the best way to do something.  
2) Morale.  

No experienced dev wants to be micromanaged like that... 
could lead to them disliking the PM and not working as efficiently.

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Let developers work in their mode

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Developers aren't simply resources

* Don't put developers on 'robot' ticket duty
* Have 1:1s that aren't specific to the project
* Check to see if devleopers are happy on the project

# Project management helps efficiency

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Don't allow the build to start too soon

* Push back against the pressure
* Helps lower re-work
* Can be used as leverage to get what you need

note:
There is sometimes pressure to start building, before scope/requirements are locked down.
Push back against this when possible. It helps avoid re-work / unscoped work.
If you need leverage to get sign-off...use this if possible
--- 
##### Project management helps efficiency

Avoid un-scoped/free work

* Client changes their mind? Track it.
* A tweak here and there may have unintended consequences
* Ambiguity in scope/contract/assumptions

note:  These things can have an impact on efficiency and team motivation.  When a change is 
requested, even if it seems minor, let a developer weigh in. Something seemingly simple can have
a major impact.  Example: Auto-sort vs custom sort.

There isn’t necessarily a need to AVOID un-scoped work altogether… instead, scope changes/additions 
need to be managed properly.  Expectations need to be set immediately when the PM senses scope change 
(some else has to be removed or rough equivalence OR we need more time/money to make the change).

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Reign in ambitious developers

* Developers sometimes advocate for scope creep
   - "We could do it this other way"
   - Want to try something new
  
note: 
Developers can get excited in wanting to try new things or approaching things in 
different ways. At times that's good. At other times, staying the course is the 
most beneficial to the project. 

---
##### Project management helps efficiency
 
Tease out when a developer is having problems

* Have an understanding of how long a task should take
* Use stand-ups / status meeting to uncover delays
 - Need help?
 - Spinning wheels
 - Other interference / distractions

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Transparency with the whole team

* Don't shield the team from the numbers 
* Not all devs need to be "behind a wall"


---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Let developers show off their work

* Let developers do demos of their work to the clients/stakeholders
 - Builds ownership within the team
 - Builds stronger rapport with the client
 - Direct feedback/conversation can spur discussion and new ideas
