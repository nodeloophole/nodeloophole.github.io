# Skills of a Drupal Team

---

## The basics

note: this is obvious, so i'm not going to dwell on the basics. 
These are the must-have skills for a someone to contribute to your team .

---
##### The Basics
## Direct Skills
Drupal, PHP, CSS, JS, Symfony

---
##### The Basics

## Related Skills
Frameworks, DevOps, Git, etc.

---
## Soft Skills

note: These skills are sometimes overlooked or seen as not required.  I say that these are
sometimes just as important as the basic skills. These skills help make sure
your team is working at peak efficiency.

---
##### Soft Skills

## Communication
* Can articulate ideas, thoughts, problems, etc.
* Not afraid to speak up
* Listening and understanding
* Uses the correct 'voice' for the audience

note:
Voice/tone/word choice varies based on the audience. For example, someone should speak at a technical
level when dealing with other developers. Potentially less technical when dealing with clients.

---
##### Soft Skills

## Bias toward action
* Eager to solve problems
* Discussion/research versus action

---
##### Soft Skills

## Constant Learning
* Growing knowledge and experience to learn at a higher level
* Proactive vs reactionary
* Recognizing "I could have done better" and learning how for next time

---
##### Soft Skills

##  Constant Mentoring

* Openly shares knowledge with others
* Knows others' areas for improvement, offers help

---
##### Soft Skills

## Taking Ownership
* Taking ownership of a task or challenge
* Finding resources to solve problems
  - People
  - Information
  - Technologies
  
---
##### Soft Skills

## Focus
* Spend effort on right priority at the right time
* Saying 'No' or 'Not now' to requests
* Push away distractions

---
##### Soft Skills

* Look for examples of these when interviewing candidates

## Assess your Drupal team

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Skills Assessment
* Be honest - internal use only
* Identify your team's strengths and weaknesses

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Technical knowledge

* Drupal - get specific
* Languages, frameworks, other technologies
* Courses, certifications, awards, etc.

note:
When assessing Drupal skills, get specific -- More than just backend / frontend for D7 or D8. Ask questions like:
Do they have knowledge with field formatters, with creating twig templates, with configuration management, with writing 
event subscribers, with the render array, etc.

For courses and certifications, get a list of these. it can be helpful to highlight these when going after new work. And
when someone gets a new certification or award, that's something for your whole team to celebrate.

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Domain knowledge

* Industry experience
* Types of clients

note:
This can include work that people have done in other industries before they worked as a developer. It can also include
the types of websites/clients that someone has experience building.  These can provide a lot of strategic information
for your organization when going after new deals or trying to find the right people to staff a new project.

---
##### Assess your Drupal team

## Identify next steps

* Find ways to improve
* Know what type of work to go for
* Know who's a rockstar
* Create a roadmap and work it

# Increasing efficiency in your Drupal team

---

# Efficiency != Productivity

* Productivity = measure of units produced
* Efficiency = amount of resources used and waste created

When there is less waste, there is more capacity to produce.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Before starting to build

* Agree on the work to be done
    - What is in scope?
    - What does done look like?
    - Have a common nomenclature for items
    
note:
Speaking the same language is critical for efficiency in your team. 
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Before starting to build

* Plan
    - Resolve as many unanswered questions as possible
    - Content model, roles and permissions
    - Know what Drupal modules to use
    - Use the right technologies for the work to be done

note: 
Plan the route before starting your journey. For the build out of a Drupal site, this can include
planning out content types, taxonomy vocabularies, modules to use, modules to build, roles and 
permissions, etc. 
 
---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Standard tools for all
 
 * Standardize the toolkit 
  - IDE
  - Development
  - Project/Task management process
  
  
note: 
Greater efficiency can be achieved if everyone is using the same tools. 

This goes back to being on the same page. 

And this not on a per-project basis, but across projects. If you can lower the amount of ramp-up time spent on a project, or on task switching time, you can be more efficient.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Have a common starting point

* Base Drupal installation profile
* Features for everyone
* Custom code snippets/scaffolding
* This is your secret recipe


---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Don't re-invent the wheel

* Avoid doing things totally different each time
* Leverage the knowledge you have
* Custom code snippets/scaffolding

note: How different are hero carousels, really? 

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Productize your solutions

* Where possible, have pre-build solutions for a fixed price
* Use that as a base and enhance per customer requirements
* Caveat: Be aware of contractual issues

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Let developers develop

* Tech support
* Unneeded meetings 
* Bureaucracy

note:
This one sounds obvious, but there are a lot of little things that add up quickly.
Things like doing internal tech support, attending meetings where the developer has no clear role or
objective for attending, 

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## It's OK to have specialists

* Not the same as putting work into a silo
* Specialists allow for deeper knowledge for the whole team

note:
Example:  configuration management or event subscribers, others can benefit from this knowledge.

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Follow good development practices

* Do the basics well
  - Coding standards
  - Code reviews
  - Documenting
  

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Build with the future in mind

* Where possible:
 - Know the goals of future versions
 - Lay the foundation for future work

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Invest in continued growth

* Training and education
* Local events - meetups, camps, etc.
* Internal training / info share

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Simplify the work

* Keep code simple
* Break down complex tasks into manageable chunks
* Don't over-engineer solutions


---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Avoid multi-tasking when possible

* Time costs related to task switching
* Better to time box effort 
* Prioritize most important work first

---
##### Increasing efficiency

## Fix bugs immediately

* Building on top of bugs, causes more bugs
* Fix bugs before you have an infestation

note:
I recommend fixing bugs immediately. Other work currently being built may incorporate the bug and 
 break when the bug is fixed.
 
"We'll fix it in QA/UAT" is a dangerous phrase.

# Keep the team motivated

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Strive for daily production


---
##### Keep the team motivated

Don't allow all-nighters

* While initially productive, it can be inefficient
 - Increased stress
 - More mistakes/bugs
 - Not sustainable
 
* Work/life balance


---
##### Keep the team motivated

Explain the "Why"

* "Why am I doing this?" can be de-motivating
* Perhaps better options are available
* Helps put this piece into the bigger picture

---
##### Keep the team motivated

Don't micro-manage

note:
Even if a PM has technical abilities, its really important to let the team architect things 
and make collective decisions.  Often times a PM that is somewhat technical will try to tell 
developers how to do something, which shoots themselves in the foot in 2 ways:  
1) It might not be the best way to do something.  
2) Morale.  

No experienced dev wants to be micromanaged like that... 
could lead to them disliking the PM and not working as efficiently.


---
##### Keep the team motivated

Developers aren't simply resources

* Don't put developers on 'robot' ticket duty
* Check in to see if developers are happy on the project
* Talk about other stuff with the team--develop rapport

---

# Project management helps efficiency

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Don't allow the build to start too soon

* Push back against the pressure
* Helps lower re-work
* Can be used as leverage to get what you need

note:
There is sometimes pressure to start building, before scope/requirements are locked down.
Push back against this when possible. It helps avoid re-work / unscoped work.
If you need leverage to get sign-off...use this if possible
--- 
##### Project management helps efficiency

Avoid un-scoped/free work

* Client changes their mind? Track it
* A tweak here and there may have unintended consequences
* Ambiguity in scope/contract/assumptions

note:  These things can have an impact on efficiency and team motivation.  When a change is 
requested, even if it seems minor, let a developer weigh in. Something seemingly simple can have
a major impact.  Example: Auto-sort vs custom sort.

There isn’t necessarily a need to AVOID un-scoped work altogether… instead, scope changes/additions 
need to be managed properly.  Expectations need to be set immediately when the PM senses scope change 
(something else has to be removed or rough equivalence OR we need more time/money to make the change).

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Reign in ambitious developers

* Developers sometimes advocate for scope creep
   - "We could do it this other way"
   - Want to try something new
  
note: 
Developers can get excited in wanting to try new things or approaching things in 
different ways. At times that's good. At other times, staying the course is the 
most beneficial to the project. 

---
##### Project management helps efficiency
 
Tease out when a developer is having problems

* Have an understanding of how long a task should take
* Use stand-ups / status meeting to uncover delays
 - Need help?
 - Spinning wheels
 - Other interference / distractions

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Transparency with the whole team

* Don't shield the team from the numbers 
* Keep everyone abreast of the latest information
* No hidden agendas, side-conversations, or masked motives
* Not all devs need to be "behind a wall"

---
##### Project management helps efficiency

Let developers show off their work

* Let developers do demos of their work to the clients/stakeholders
 - Builds ownership within the team
 - Builds stronger rapport with the client
 - Direct feedback/conversation can spur discussion and new ideas
